Imports
python
Copy code
from user_interface import display_menu, get_user_choice
from notes_manager import load_notes, save_notes, add_note, edit_note, delete_note, view_notes
Imports: This section imports functions from two modules, user_interface and notes_manager. These functions handle displaying the menu, getting user input, and managing notes (loading, saving, adding, editing, deleting, and viewing).
Main Function
python
Copy code
def main():
    notes = load_notes()  # Load existing notes
main(): The main function is where the program starts executing. It first loads existing notes from a file using the load_notes() function.
Infinite Loop
python
Copy code
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = get_user_choice()
Loop: An infinite loop keeps the program running until the user chooses to exit. Inside the loop:
display_menu(): Displays the options available to the user.
get_user_choice(): Gets the user's choice as input.
Handling User Choices
python
Copy code
        if choice == '1':
            title = input("Enter note title: ")
            content = input("Enter note content: ")
            add_note(notes, title, content)
Choice 1: If the user selects option 1, they are prompted to enter a note title and content. The add_note() function is called to append the new note to the notes list.
python
Copy code
        elif choice == '2':
            view_notes(notes)
Choice 2: If the user selects option 2, the view_notes() function is called to display all existing notes.
python
Copy code
        elif choice == '3':
            index = int(input("Enter note index to edit: ")) - 1
            new_title = input("Enter new title: ")
            new_content = input("Enter new content: ")
            edit_note(notes, index, new_title, new_content)
Choice 3: For editing a note, the user is prompted to enter the index of the note they wish to edit (adjusted by subtracting 1 for zero-based indexing). Then, they are asked for new title and content, which are passed to the edit_note() function.
python
Copy code
        elif choice == '4':
            index = int(input("Enter note index to delete: ")) - 1
            delete_note(notes, index)
Choice 4: Similar to editing, the user is prompted for the index of the note to delete. The delete_note() function removes the specified note from the list.
python
Copy code
        elif choice == '5':
            save_notes(notes)
            break
Choice 5: When the user chooses to exit, save_notes() is called to save all notes to a file, and the loop breaks to terminate the program.
python
Copy code
        else:
            print("Invalid choice, please try again.")
Invalid Choice: If the input doesn’t match any option, an error message is displayed, and the loop continues.
Entry Point Check
python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
This condition checks if the script is being run directly (as opposed to being imported). If true, it calls the main() function.
Note Management Functions
Load Notes
python
Copy code
def load_notes():
    notes = []
    try:
        with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:
            for line in file:
                title, content = line.strip().split("|")
                notes.append({"title": title, "content": content})
    except FileNotFoundError:
        pass
    return notes
load_notes(): This function reads notes from a file. Each line in the file is split into title and content using the | character. If the file doesn’t exist, it simply returns an empty list.
Save Notes
python
Copy code
def save_notes(notes):
    with open("notes.txt", "w") as file:
        for note in notes:
            file.write(f"{note['title']}|{note['content']}\n")
save_notes(): This function writes all notes back to the file, formatting them as title|content.
Add Note
python
Copy code
def add_note(notes, title, content):
    notes.append({"title": title, "content": content})
add_note(): This function appends a new note (as a dictionary) to the notes list.
View Notes
python
Copy code
def view_notes(notes):
    for i, note in enumerate(notes):
        print(f"{i+1}. {note['title']}")
        print(f"   {note['content']}\n")
view_notes(): This function iterates over the notes and prints the title and content, with indexing starting from 1 for user-friendliness.
Edit Note
python
Copy code
def edit_note(notes, index, new_title, new_content):
    if 0 <= index < len(notes):
        notes[index]["title"] = new_title
        notes[index]["content"] = new_content
    else:
        print("Invalid index.")
edit_note(): This function updates the title and content of a note at a specified index. It checks if the index is valid.
Delete Note
python
Copy code
def delete_note(notes, index):
    if 0 <= index < len(notes):
        del notes[index]
    else:
        print("Invalid index.")
delete_note(): Similar to edit_note(), this function deletes a note if the index is valid.
Display Menu
python
Copy code
def display_menu():
    print("\nOptions:")
    print("1. Add Note")
    print("2. View Notes")
    print("3. Edit Note")
    print("4. Delete Note")
    print("5. Exit")
display_menu(): This function prints the available options for the user.
Get User Choice
python
Copy code
def get_user_choice():
    choice = input("Choose an operation: ")
    return choice
get_user_choice(): This function prompts the user for input and returns the choice.
Summary
This code provides a simple command-line interface for managing notes. It allows users to add, view, edit, and delete notes, with persistent storage through a text file. Each function has a specific responsibility, making the code modular and easier to maintain.
